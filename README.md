# based-file-converter
a file converter that isn't malware and is simple. it just works. that's it.
A simple, free, and open-source Python-based file converter. The current version supports converting PDF files to DOCX format, and it includes image extraction and basic text formatting. Now with MOV to MP4 and other audio and video file extensions, with more being added later on.

- PDF to DOCX
- Extracts text and images from the PDF.
- Preserves basic text formatting.
- Simple status bar at the bottom
- Extremely plain and painfully easy to use GUI
- Bi- directional conversion of applicable file types
- drop down menu instead of huge stupid buttons
 
          *file types*
  PDF, DOCX, MP4, MP3, WAV, AAC, FLAC, MOV, M4A, WMA, MPG (mpeg), WEBM, WEBP

  *more added soon*
  

  it seems like nowadays, converting a file requires us to download VLC or some other program like audacity or use
  some online file converter that looks sketchy af. And recent reports of malware/ransomware in file converters is just.....
  plain stupidity. download python, FFmpeg, and use this instead. its free, its open-source, do
  whatever you want with it. i'm just here to learn more about python and have some fun along the way.

  *other features, file formats, and more will be added soon.... when i have some time.....*
